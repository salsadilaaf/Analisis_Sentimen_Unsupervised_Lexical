# Analisis Sentimen Unsupervised Lexical
Analisis Sentimen Review Shopee dengan Metode Unsupervised Lexical

This project performs sentiment analysis on Shopee product reviews using an unsupervised lexical approach. Since the dataset does not contain labeled sentiment values, we utilize a custom-built sentiment dictionary to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on word occurrences.

Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares Shopee review data
- Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis: Uses a handcrafted sentiment lexicon
- No Labeled Data Required: Sentiment classification is rule-based, without the need for manual annotations
- Data Visualization: Generates insights through graphs and charts

Process Overview:
1. Data Cleaning: Remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stopwords
2. Sentiment Scoring: Compare words in reviews against a predefined sentiment dictionary
3. Classification: Assign sentiment categories based on the calculated score
4. Visualization: Display sentiment distribution and key insights
